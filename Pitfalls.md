## Current Evaluation Scenario Pitfalls
1. **Presenting your design is not the same as evaluating your design**

   While the former requires the mindset of defending design choices(to some degree) the other requires a very unbiased and open mind to critique.

2. **Not all feedback is equal**

   Open ended questions such as “What do you think about this design?” while useful can yield ALL SORTS of feedbackThis poses a serious challenge especially, in light of the limited time we have, to not only garner feedback but also to make changes based on feedback

3. **1ish hour, 5+ ppl, exacerbates this problem**

   Group evaluation methods while acceptable should be heavily moderated so that the evaluation process is democratic and not overtaken by the strongest most dominant voice in the roomFailing to do so leaves room open for existing hierarchical structures to interfere with the evaluation process and could lead to a high status stakeholder subduing an end-user’s feedback

4. **Feedback for the sake of feedback**

Burden of feedback should be borne collectively by the Designer and the StakeholdersBy leaving the floor open and placing the burden on stakeholders we expose ourselves to receiving feedback for the sake of feedback or worse none at all

5. **Providing a link to InVision is not a proxy**

   ..and we as UX designers should know thatThere is lack of incentive  to leave feedback and what’s more is that the lack of scaffolding can discourage users from providing feedback Some users may experience lack of confidence in how valuable their feedback is and thus we need some prompts to make this process more rewarding to both parties.

## Where does this leave us?

Tons of techniques to uncover all kinds of feedback. But our resources are limited. As such, to reduce the risk of redesign we have to distribute the process of evaluation and quality control.

The Solution—

> **Heuristic techniques** often called simply a heuristic. It is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals. 
>
> Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution.Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. 
>
> Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, guesstimate, stereotyping, profiling, or common sense.
