# Background

â€” Why evaluation is important, and how this repo deconstructs the process.

## How to use this toolkit

1. **Setting the Stage**: Before beginning the tests, it will be helpful to 
   - Understand the [pitfalls](Pitfalls.md) with the current evaluation methodologies, in order to prevent yourself from falling into them, and
   - Equip yourself with the [testing mindset](TestingMindset.md) in order to properly set expectations.
2. **Follow best practices:** This serves as an initial self-directed evaluation, intended to help you determine whether your visualization is following best practices, particularly in regard to styling. Reference the [data visualization checklist](./Assets/DataVizChecklist_May2016.pdf) prepared by Stephanie Evergreen and Ann K. Emery to evaluate specific UI elements such as typography, color, and arrangement.
3. **Know what to measure:** Next, you can begin the process of user testing by first determining what you speficially want to test and measure, and what attributes you want to prioritize for your dashboard. Do you want to test its usability, usefulness, desirability, or a combination of these attributes? Reference the [Determining what to measure](./2.Determining-what-to-measure/README.md) section for a list of questions that can be asked to help you determine whether your visualization achieves your prioritized attributes.
4. **Know how to measure:** Now that you have pinpointed the relevant questions and attributes, you can use reference this page to devise a testing plan and methodology.


Eventually, the goal is to be able to fill out something like this [excel doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfcPwG4gH-rQQhl5MuXgNevy8_hlJPvdx6_RiLT34qw/edit#gid=0) that tracks how research questions mature as the design sprint progresses and what methods were used to answer those questions.
