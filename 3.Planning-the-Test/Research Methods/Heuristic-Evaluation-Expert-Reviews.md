# Heuristic Evaluations and Expert Reviews

### What is it?

As per Usability.gov—

> In a heuristic evaluation, usability experts review your site’s interface and compare it against accepted usability principles. The analysis results in a list of potential usability issues.

A heuristic evaluation however is not a substitute for a usability testing. "You are not your user" is one of the core principles of UX and the testing process is no exception. However, having said that, the heuristic method is a great way to get quick feedback early in the project. Additionally, it helps iron out some of the minor usability issues that would be a distraction to your user and focus on the core research questions for your usability test.
