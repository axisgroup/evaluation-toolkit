# Heuristic Evaluations and Expert Reviews

### What is it?

As per Usability.gov—

> In a heuristic evaluation, usability experts review your site’s interface and compare it against accepted usability principles. The analysis results in a list of potential usability issues.

A heuristic evaluation however is not a substitute for a usability testing. "You are not your user" is one of the core principles of UX and the testing process is no exception. However, having said that, the heuristic method is a great way to get quick feedback early in the project. Additionally, it helps iron out some of the minor usability issues that would be a distraction to your user and focus on the core research questions for your usability test.

### How to do it?

- Prepare a list of heuristic principles to measure against (in our case follow the Best Practices Guide, or pick criteria from the Knowing What to Measure Guide)

- Recruit Experts

- Walk them through the goals of the project and the interface to be tested

- Make a list of all usability problems identified by the experts. Combine similar problems as one if need be.

- For each problem identified:

Determine Severity Ranking

0-Violates a heuristic but doesn’t seem to be a usability problem.
1-Superficial usability problem: may be easily overcome by user or occurs extremely
infrequently. Does not need to be fixed for next release unless extra time is available.
2-Minor usability problem: may occur more frequently or be more difficult to overcome.
Fixing this should be given low priority for next release.
3-Major usability problem: occurs frequently and persistently or users may be unable or unaware of how to fix the problem. Important to fix, so should be given high priority.
4-Usability catastrophe: Seriously impairs use of product and cannot be overcome by users. Imperative to fix this before product can be released.
 
Determine Ease of fixing Ranking:
 
0-Problem would be extremely easy to fix. Could be completed by one team member before next release.
1-Problem would be easy to fix. Involves specific interface elements and solution is clear.
2-Problem would require some effort to fix. Involves multiple aspects of the interface or
would require team of developers to implement changes before next release or solution is not clear.
3-Usability problem would be difficult to fix. Requires concentrated development effort to finish before next release, involves multiple aspects of interface. Solution may not be immediately obvious or may be disputed.

- Put all results in a table

- Prepare a list of design implications or changes. You ay categorize them as trivial, important and critical.
