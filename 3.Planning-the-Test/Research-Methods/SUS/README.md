### What is SUS?

According to [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)— 

> The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a “quick and dirty”, reliable tool for measuring the usability.   It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree.  Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, it allows you to evaluate a wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications.  

It is important to understand that the SUS is not a diagnostic tool and it will not help you prepare a list of usability issues that need to be addressed. Instead, use it as a validation tool to describe the ease of use of the system or application being tested.

### How to use it?

- Identify participants that have had exposure to the application. This could be by way of using a tool frequently or being exposed to it during a usability test session.
- Administer the [SUS questionnaire](http://www.measuringux.com/sus.pdf) to your participants. For ease of use we have a handy [Google Form SUS Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ETKDGN38acgyglEb7lAApT3792VklHKQ4EUnXr84Ox8)
