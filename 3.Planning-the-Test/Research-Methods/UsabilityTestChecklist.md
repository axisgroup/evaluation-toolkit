### Usability Test Checklist

> This is a simple checklist that can apply to every usability test session you’ll ever perform. I created this checklist based on my own mistakes over the years. Believe me, missing some of these points can deal a serious blow to your test and your ego. Delete this comment and carry a copy of this checklist to each of your tests. 

#### Pre-test activities

- Write down test hypothesis 
- Form scenarios and tasks for the test
- Recruit participants
- Schedule sessions

#### Before each session

- Make sure you know name of the participant
- Print out “Task and scenarios” for participant
- Make sure you know name of the participant
- Make sure you have two pens (one for you, one  for participant)


- Check if your recording software works
- Check if you have your ethernet cable connected and wifi set up as a backup option for Internet Connection


- Check mouse and keyboard (set them to default settings)


- If you’re using a laptop – connect it to the power source


- Make sure that you don’t have any customized keyboard shortcuts turned on


- Turn off any unnecessary software
- Open the web browser (if used) on a neutral page (e.g. Google)

#### During each session

- Welcome the participant and introduce yourself
- Explain the reason for the session
- Explain “Think out loud” protocol
- Give participants “Permission for recording” form
- Give participants other forms (if applicable)
- Turn on the screen recorder
- Ask, easy-to-answer, introduction questions
- Read first task and hand it to participant

##### Repeat for each task

- Ask participants about their questions
- Hand post-test questionnaire
- Thank and compensate the user for participation

#### After each session

- Make sure you have all the documents signed
- Make a backup copy of the recording
- Analyze the recording as soon as possible
