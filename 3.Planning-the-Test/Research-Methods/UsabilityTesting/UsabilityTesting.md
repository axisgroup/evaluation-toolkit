## Planning your Test
https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/boards/4517347

A usability test is a technique to uncover UX design problems with actual users of the system.

### What do you need?

- A purpose- knowing why you are testing is very important; Use the [previous section](../2. Determining what to measure) to decide what you plan to test
- A prototype- you can use prototypes of varying fidelity ranging from a paper prototype to an interactive mockup.


- Users- The number of users you need to recruit for a test depends on your research methods. Generally, Quantitative studies require 


- Facilitator- Usually, a usability professional and whose role is to record the issues raised during the meeting.


- Human Computer(for paper prototypes)- This person (typically the lead developer or someone who knows how the system is supposed to work) manipulates the paper prototype so that it can provide the feedback based on the user’s interaction.
- Instruments/ Tools to capture test results eg. a questionnnaire, a time-recording software etc.

### Choosing the Right Test

In the free [Guide to Usability Testing](http://proxystudio.uxpin.com/ebooks/guide-to-usability-testing/), we divide the tests into four categories based on Christian Rohrer’s [fantastic article](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/):

- **Scripted** —These tests analyze the user’s interaction with the product based on set instructions, targeting more specific goals and individual elements. (tree testing, hallway usability tests, benchmark testing)


- **Decontextualized** — Ideal for preliminary user testing and persona research, these tests don’t necessarily involve the product, but analyze more generalized and theoretical topics, targeting idea generation and broad opinions. (user interviews, surveys, card sorting)


- **Natural (or near-natural)** — By analyzing the user in their own environment, these tests examine how users behave and pinpoint their feelings with accuracy, at the cost of control. (field and diary studies, A/B testing, first click testing, beta testing)


- **Hybrid** — These experimental tests forego traditional methods to take an unparalleled look at the user’s mentality. (participatory design, quick exposure memory testing, adjective cards)

*Brain dump Examples of what all can be tested-
Tradeoffs involved
… Hence, one has to be intentional about what to test.
- Open ended tests reveal all sorts of feedback, with a UI as complex as a dashboard this can pose a serious challenge as there are so many rabbit holes you could fall under*
