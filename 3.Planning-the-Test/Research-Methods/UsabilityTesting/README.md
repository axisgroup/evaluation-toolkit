## What is a Usability test?
A usability test is a technique to uncover UX design problems with actual users of the system.

### What do you need?

- A purpose- knowing why you are testing is very important; Use the [previous section](../2. Determining what to measure) to decide what you plan to test

- A prototype- you can use prototypes of varying fidelity ranging from a paper prototype to an interactive mockup.


- Users- The number of users you need to recruit for a test depends on your research methods. Generally, Quantitative studies require 


- Facilitator- Usually, a usability professional and whose role is to record the issues raised during the meeting.

- A task- These can range from close ended tasks with clear end goals to open ended taks

- Human Computer(for paper prototypes)- This person (typically the lead developer or someone who knows how the system is supposed to work) manipulates the paper prototype so that it can provide the feedback based on the user’s interaction.

- Instruments/Tools to capture test results eg. a questionnnaire, a time-recording software etc.

### Recruiting the right users

You should know your target audience by now. It also helps to segment your users based on behavior. In fact, you shouldn’t obsess over demographics. The biggest differentiator will likely be whether users have prior experience or are knowledgeable about their domain or industry — not gender, age, or geography.Source: http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/02/how-to-test-the-usability-of-prototypes-like-a-pro/

### Writing tasks
We established earlier that Usability Tests should be purposeful so as to not generate all kinds of feedback. Therefore, it is good to have specific tasks in mind when planning a Usability Test. Designing tasks should be a careful and thoughtful activity. For eg. in Jared Spool's example when he and his team were conducting a Usability test for IKEA, they had already started the  testing process.The Task: “Find a bookcase.”The Result: All participants searched for 'bookcase' in the search box.The Spin: Jared and his team decided to change this prompt to “You have 200+ books in your fiction collection, currently in boxes strewn around your living room. Find a way to organize them.”The Result: User behavior changed. Most clicked through the various categories, looking for some sort of storage solution. Few used Search, typing in phrases like “Shelves” and “Storage Systems”. And, nobody searched on “bookcase”.Takeaway: Tasks may direct users path in a way that is different from their context of use.You can get around this mistake by constantly exploring the “context of use.” When designing tasks, ask yourself, “What events or conditions in the world would motivate someone to use this design?” Use the answers as the primary formation of the tasks you create.Source: https://articles.uie.com/usability_testing_mistakes/

### More on writing tasks
The tasks could be categorized into two main formats:Direct tasks or Scenario tasksOpen-ended or Closed taskScenario task or Direct taskA scenario task is presented as a mini user story: often it has the character, the context and the necessary details for achieving the goal. For example, to test the browser and bottom menu on the phone:"You are holding a dinner party this Saturday. You want to find a chicken curry recipe from the BBC food site."A direct task is purely instructional. For instance, to use the above example:"Find a chicken curry recipe from the BBC food site."Closed task or Open-ended task A closed task is specific to what the participants need to do. This type of task has one correct answer, and therefore allows us to measure if participants solved or failed a task. It is the most commonly used format. For example, to test the telephony on the phone:" You want to text your landlord to say you will give her the rent tomorrow. Her number is: 7921233290."An open-ended task contains minimum information and less specific direction as to what you want a participant to do. It gives users more freedom to explore the system. This is particularly useful if you want to find out about what areas users would spontaneously interact with, or which ones matter most to them.For example, in our Ubuntu.com testing, designers wanted to understand what information was important for users to get to know about Ubuntu. In this case, an open-ended task would be appropriate. I used the task: "You heard your friends mention something called ‘Ubuntu’. You are interested in it and want to find out more about what Ubuntu is and what it can offer you?

*Brain dump Examples of what all can be tested-
Tradeoffs involved
… Hence, one has to be intentional about what to test.
- Open ended tests reveal all sorts of feedback, with a UI as complex as a dashboard this can pose a serious challenge as there are so many rabbit holes you could fall under*
