# Planning your Test

Usability testing can uncover *all kinds* of feedback. **The foremost step in planning our test is picking a direction for the test.** The previous sections help us frame questions about what we want to get out of the test.

The next step is for us to apply research methods and test with our users.  A quick search on Usability.gov reveals more than just a few methods to garner feedback from users from—baseline [usability testing](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html) on an existing product/service to [first click testing](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/first-click-testing.html) to make sure our users go down the right path to satisfaction [surveys](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/online-surveys.html) to see how our product/service  fares in the real world.

And while at first this choice can seem overwhelming, it is important to realize that real-life constraints such as our research questions or our users' availability can help us narrow down the choices. In the next section we will attempt to break down the various steps involved when planning a usability test and provide some guidelines for each.

### Overview of UX Research Landscape
Before we dive deep into specific methods that make sense in the Axis Design context we will take a quick broad look at the overall research landscape.

This section explores the wide array of research methods available to researchers based on Christian Rohrer's—Chief Design Officer in the Consumer Division at McAfee,Inc.—excellent article [When to Use Which User-Experience Research Methods](When to Use Which User-Experience Research Methods) for NNGroup.

It then attempts to make some decisions about which methods are recommended given the Axis Design context.

The following **3-dimensional framework** with the following axes helps us simplify the task of selecting a research method- 

- Attitudinal vs. Behavioral
- Qualitative vs. Quantitative
- Context of Use

#### Attitudinal vs. Behavioral

According to Rohrer's article "this distinction can be summed up by contrasting **"what people say"** versus **"what people do"** (very often the two are quite different). The purpose of attitudinal research is usually to understand or measure people's stated beliefs, which is why attitudinal research is used heavily in marketing departments."

#### Quantitative vs. Qualitative

Both quantitative and qualitative methods are valid for evaluating visualizations. You can choose to just go with one method or use a combination of both depending what you are trying to measure. Rohrer captures the essence of these two methods when he says—

"The distinction here is an important one, and goes well beyond the narrow view of qualitative as “open ended” as in an open-ended survey question.  Rather, studies that are qucalitative in nature generate data about behaviors or attitudes based on observing them *directly*, whereas in quantitative studies, the data about the behavior or attitudes in question are gathered *indirectly*, through a measurement or an instrument such as a survey or an [analytics tool](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/analytics-user-experience/)." 

He then continues to explain what these methods are suited for—

"Due to the [nature of their differences](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/risks-of-quantitative-studies/), **qualitative** methods are much better suited for answering questions about **why or how to fix a problem** whereas **quantitative** methods do a much better job answering **how many and how much types of questions.**"

#### The Context of Product Use

However there is a third dimension that has to do with direct and indirect use of the product of the service and the setting therein. In UXPin's [The Guide to Usability Testing](http://gibbon.co/c/1ada73ea-1f19-450d-bc35-64c6c436bcae/the-guide-to-usability-testing-free-ebook-by-ux) they have summarized Rohrer's note as—

```
1. Scripted use of the product — These tests focus on specific usage aspects.
The degree of scripting varies, with more scripting generating more controlled data.

2. Decontextualized use the product — Tests that don’t use the product
— at least in the actual testing phase — are designed for broader topics like UX or generating ideas.

3. Natural (and near-natural) use of the product — 
These tests seek to analyze common usage behaviors and trends with the product, 
doing well with data authenticity at the cost of control.

4. Hybrid — Hybrid tests are creative and non-traditional tests. 
Geared towards understanding the users’ mentality, these tests vary in what they can accomplish.

## Choosing the right tasks

## Other Considerations

In addition to the dimensions described by Rohrer, your test methodology also depends on-

- functionality afforded by the prototype
- access to testing tools and equipment

## Revisiting goals of testing

- disagnostic recommend improvements
- reduce risk of redesign
- make it work in the specific context, generalizatbility is not important

## Putting a stake in the ground

WIP

— so many decisions can seem overwhelming

— but in reality goals and constraints help determine direction

— we are testing for diagnostic reasons not scientific so it is okay to use hybrid methods without too much rigidity; +Our aims are not purely scientific and still need to be adjusted to meet stakeholder needs. 

— we are testing overall UX not a very specific part, so it is okay to have broad open ended taks

— sample size is limited
