## The Complexity in our Stars or Why Data Vis is inherently hard to test
*WIP needs attribution and citations*

### Faster is not necessarily better

Visualization is outcome driven. Very rarely are our users making  visceral decisions based on a vis, and while we care about the affective value of a vis, we don’t want them making emotional decisions (as we would on an ecommerce site). We don’t want to penalize a vis because it makes a user think. Similarly, no. of errors is not a good measure either.

### Too many moving parts
While for some usability studies, there may be an obvious and limited set of interface elements that should be tested. In many cases, however, the system is complex, new to the researcher, or the list of candidate features for testing is long. The following image demonstrates how quickly typographic elements can scale up in a dashboard, moving well beyond the typical h1, h2, h3, and so on,  elements used in websites.

### Operationalization is hard
E.g. If you want to measure how many insights are dervived using one visualization versus another, how do you define what constitutes an insight in the first place?

### Deciding Test Methodology


**Attitudnal vs. Behavioral**
> This distinction can be summed up by contrasting "what people say" versus "what people do" (very often the two are quite different). The purpose of attitudinal research is usually to understand or measure people's stated beliefs, which is why attitudinal research is used heavily in marketing departments.



**Quantitative vs. Qualitative Dimension**
Both quantitative and qualitative methods are valid for evaluating visualizations. You can choose to just go with one method or use a combination of both depending what you are trying to measure. Quantitative methods usually include close ended questions where something is measured on a scale. Qualitative methods include more open ended questions to get descriptive and free form feedback. Using the quantitative method, you can create a survey that measures how useful users found a visualization on a scale of 1 to 5. You can then use the qualitative method to ask users who entered a low rating a follow up question on why they did not find application useful. Quantitative methods will identify the strengths and weakness of your data visualization. Qualitative methods will uncover the "why" or the cause of those strengths/weaknesses.
