- disagnostic recommend improvements
- reduce risk of redesign
- make it work in the specific context, generalizatbility is not important

## Putting a stake in the ground

WIP

— so many decisions can seem overwhelming

— but in reality goals and constraints help determine direction

— we are testing for diagnostic reasons not scientific so it is okay to use hybrid methods without too much rigidity; +Our aims are not purely scientific and still need to be adjusted to meet stakeholder needs. 

— we are testing overall UX not a very specific part, so it is okay to have broad open ended taks

— sample size is limited
