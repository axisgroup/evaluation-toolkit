## Conveying Test Results

Once you are done evaluating your prototype,the next step is to analyze the results, convey these test results to your audience and implement changes. 

### Analyzing results


"Note the severity of the problems on a three- or four-point scale. For example:  
Critical:  If we do not fix this, users will not be able to complete the scenario.
Serious:  Many users will be frustrated if we do not fix this; they may give up.
Minor:  Users are annoyed, but this does not keep them from completing the scenario. This should be revisited later."
Some factors that influence the severity of the problem are frequency of issues and impact of issues.

The next step is to generate solution ideas for each issue starting with the most critical issues. Use the potential actions checklist to identify what changes can be made.
