# Heuristic Evaluations and Expert Reviews


### What is it?

In a heuristic evaluation, usability experts review the dashboard and evaluate it based on accepted design principles. The results of the evaluation should lead to potential usability issues.

### Why do it?

The heuristic evaluation is a great way to get quick feedback early in the project. Additionally, it helps iron out some of the minor usability issues that would otherwise be a distraction to your user, and it helps to determine the focus and core research questions for your usability test.

That being said, it is **not a substitute for a usability testing.** ["You are not your user"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/) is one of the core principles of UX and the testing process is no exception. 

### When should you do it?

This method is most effective before testing with the user, so that obivious usability issues can be ironed out and research questions can be refined. 

### How to do it?

1. Prepare a list of heuristic principles to measure against (in our case follow the [Best Practices Guide](/1.Follow-best-practices), or pick criteria from the [Useful, Usable, Desirable Framework](/2.Determine-research-questions))

2. Recruit Experts

3. Explain the goals of the project and the interface to be tested

Set expectations. The expert should not feel the burden to find issues in violation of every best practice—  rather, the best practices section is simply a guide to be able to categorize issues, as well as to prime them to think about potential issues

4. Walk them through specific task scenarios so that they can find issues while exploring the interface. Reference the ["Choosing the Right Tasks"](https://github.com/axisgroup/evaluation-toolkit/tree/master/3.Plan-the-test#choosing-the-right-tasks) section for details. 

5. Make a list of all usability problems identified by the experts. Combine similar problems as one if need be.

6. For each problem identified, determine its severity rating:

- 0: Violates a heuristic but doesn’t seem to be a usability problem.

- 1: Superficial usability problem. May be easily overcome by user or occurs extremely infrequently. Does not need to be fixed for next release unless extra time is available.

- 2: Minor usability problem. May occur more frequently or be more difficult to overcome. Fixing this should be given low priority for next release.

- 3: Major usability problem. Occurs frequently and persistently or users may be unable or unaware of how to fix the problem. Important to fix, so should be given high priority.

- 4: Usability catastrophe. Seriously impairs use of product and cannot be overcome by users. Imperative to fix this before product can be released.

7. Determine Ease of Fixing rating: 
- 0: Problem would be extremely easy to fix. Could be completed by one team member before next release.
- 1: Problem would be easy to fix. Involves specific interface elements and solution is clear.
- 2: Problem would require some effort to fix. Involves multiple aspects of the interface or would require team of developers to implement changes before next release or solution is not clear.
- 3: Usability problem would be difficult to fix. Requires concentrated development effort to finish before next release, involves multiple aspects of interface. Solution may not be immediately obvious or may be disputed.

8. Put all results in a table

9. Prepare a list of design implications or changes. You may categorize them as trivial, important, or critical. Use the [Checklist of potential actions](/5.Act-on-your-findings/Checklist-of-potential-actions.md) to aid you with this step.
