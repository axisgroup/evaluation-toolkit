## Executive Summary

### What is a Usability test?

A usability test is a technique to uncover UX design problems with actual users of the system.

### When should you do it?

This test can be performed at any stage of the process with any(low, mid or high) fidelity of prototypes. 

### Why should you do it?

To make sure you are building the product right

### How do you do it?

#### Things you need

- A purpose- knowing why you are testing is very important; Use the [previous section](../2. Determining what to measure) to decide what you plan to test

- A prototype- you can use prototypes of varying fidelity ranging from a paper prototype to an interactive mockup.


- Users- The number of users you need to recruit for a test depends on your research methods. Generally, Quantitative studies require 


- Facilitator- Usually, a usability professional and whose role is to record the issues raised during the meeting.

- A task- These can range from close ended tasks with clear end goals to open ended taks

- Human Computer(for paper prototypes)- This person (typically the lead developer or someone who knows how the system is supposed to work) manipulates the paper prototype so that it can provide the feedback based on the user’s interaction.

- Instruments/Tools to capture test results eg. a questionnnaire, a time-recording software etc.

The following a simple checklist of steps to be followed that can apply to almost any usability test session you’ll ever perform. This has been borrowed [UXPin's free ebook on usability testing](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/new-usability-testing-kit-ready-download-free/).

#### Pre-test activities

- Write down test hypothesis 
- Form scenarios and tasks for the test
- Recruit participants
- Schedule sessions

#### Before each session

- Make sure you know name of the participant
- Print out “Task and scenarios” for participant
- Make sure you know name of the participant
- Make sure you have two pens (one for you, one  for participant)


- Check if your recording software works
- Check if you have your ethernet cable connected and wifi set up as a backup option for Internet Connection


- Check mouse and keyboard (set them to default settings)


- If you’re using a laptop – connect it to the power source


- Make sure that you don’t have any customized keyboard shortcuts turned on


- Turn off any unnecessary software
- Open the web browser (if used) on a neutral page (e.g. Google)

#### During each session

- Welcome the participant and introduce yourself
- Explain the reason for the session
- Explain [“Think out loud”](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/) protocol
- Give participants “Permission for recording” form
- Give participants other forms (if applicable)
- Turn on the screen recorder
- Ask, easy-to-answer, introduction questions
- Read first task and hand it to participant

##### Repeat for each task

- Ask participants about their questions
- Hand post-test questionnaire
- Thank and compensate the user for participation

#### After each session

- Make sure you have all the documents signed
- Make a backup copy of the recording
- Analyze the recording as soon as possible
