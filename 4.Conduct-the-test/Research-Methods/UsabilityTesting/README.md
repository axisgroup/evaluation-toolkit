# User-Based Usability Test

### What is it?

A user-based usability test is a technique to uncover UX design problems with actual users of the system, particularly by having them perform a set of representative tasks.

### Why do it?

Because the users are your most critical source of feedback, especially when it comes to determining the success of your project! User-based usability testing will uncover problems in both the interface as well as the content, and will help guide the next iteration of solutions.

### When should you do it?

The earlier and more frequent that these can take place, the better, so that the design can better align to the user's needs and expected experience. The later in development that this testing takes place, the less likely it will actually impact the design.  

Having said that, user-based testing should take place at every stage of the proces right from paper prototypes to non-functional screen mockups to interactive prototypes.


### How do you do it?

The following checklist is from [UXPin's Usability Testing Kit](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/new-usability-testing-kit-ready-download-free/), and we think it's an excellent guide for performing usability test sessions. This checklist can be downloaded [here](../UsabilityTesting/UXPIN_Usability_Test_Checklist.docx). We've also included other references from the UX Pin usability testing kit in this folder. 

#### Pre-test activities

Use the [previous section](/3.Plan-the-test) to help you perform the following activities: 

- Write down test hypothesis 
- Form scenarios and tasks for the test 
- Recruit participants
- Schedule sessions

#### Before each session

- Make sure you know name of the participant
- Print out “Task and scenarios” for participant
- Make sure you have two pens (one for you, one  for participant)
- Check if your recording software works
- Check if you have your ethernet cable connected and wifi set up as a backup option for Internet Connection
- Check mouse and keyboard (set them to default settings)
- If you’re using a laptop – connect it to the power source
- Make sure that you don’t have any customized keyboard shortcuts turned on
- Turn off any unnecessary software
- Open the web browser (if used) on a neutral page (e.g. Google)

#### During each session

- Welcome the participant and introduce yourself
- Explain the reason for the session
- Explain [“Think out loud”](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/) protocol
- Give participants [“Permission for recording” form](../UsabilityTesting/UXPIN_Permission_to_record.docx)
- Give participants other forms (if applicable)
- Turn on the screen recorder
- Ask, easy-to-answer, introduction questions (reference [Test Script](../UsabilityTesting/UXPIN_Usability_Test_Script.docx) for specifics)
- Read first task and hand it to participant
- Jot down notes using the [UX Pin Template](../UsabilityTesting/UXPIN_Usability_Test_Notes.docx) or the [Axis template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfcPwG4gH-rQQhl5MuXgNevy8_hlJPvdx6_RiLT34qw/edit#gid=0) 

*Repeat for each task*  
- Ask participants about their questions
- Hand post-test questionnaire
- Thank and compensate the user for participation

#### After each session

- Make sure you have all the documents signed
- Make a backup copy of the recording
- Analyze the recording as soon as possible
- Sum up your findings a report using UX Pin's template [report](../UsabilityTesting/UXPIN_Usability_Report_Template.docx))
