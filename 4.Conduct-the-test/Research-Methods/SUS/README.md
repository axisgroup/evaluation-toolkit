### What is SUS?

According to [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)— 

> The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a “quick and dirty”, reliable tool for measuring the usability.   It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree.  Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, it allows you to evaluate a wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications.  

### When to use SUS?
The SUS can be used early in the process to examine the usability of the current solution and at the end of the design phase in order to generate a usability metric for the design you produced. It can also be periodically sent out to users post release in order to keep a check on usability issues thar arise in practice.


### Why use SUS?
It is important to understand that the SUS is not a diagnostic tool and it will not help you prepare a list of usability issues that need to be addressed. Instead, use it as a validation tool to describe the ease of use of the system or application being tested.

### How to use it?

- Identify participants that have had exposure to the application. This could be by way of using a tool frequently or being exposed to it during a usability test session.

- Administer the [SUS questionnaire](http://www.measuringux.com/sus.pdf) to your participants. For ease of use we have a handy [Google Form SUS Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ETKDGN38acgyglEb7lAApT3792VklHKQ4EUnXr84Ox8)

- The [Measuring Usability website](https://measuringu.com/sus/) has a handy guide on scoring and interpreting SUS questionnaires.

  > ### Scoring SUS
  >
  > - For odd items: subtract one from the user response.
  > - For even-numbered items: subtract the user responses from 5
  > - This scales all values from 0 to 4 (with four being the most positive response).
  > - Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total by 2.5. This converts the range of possible values from 0 to 100 instead of from 0 to 40.
  >
  > ### Interpreting SUS Scores
  >
  > Despite the wide usage of SUS, there has been little guidance on interpreting SUS scores, acceptable modifications to the items and information on reliability and validity.
  >
  > Over the years I’ve used SUS a lot in my own research and during usability evaluations. During this time I’ve reviewed the existing research on SUS and analyzed data from over 5000 users across 500 different evaluations.
  >
  > This data shows that SUS is a reliable and valid measure of perceived usability. It performs as well or better than commercial questionnaires and home-grown internal questionnaires.
  >
  > I’ve put these findings in a [150 page detailed report](http://www.measuringusability.com/products/SUSpack) which contains valuable insights on background, benchmarks and best practices for anyone using the SUS. Here are a few highlights.

- Axis Group has a handy [Google Sheets Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uj3wfAPWDsu69uAFu8zi4d5O0rs3G5MWt4SZru7ld-A/edit?usp=sharing) with the formulas built in which you may copy over and link to the  [Google Form SUS Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ETKDGN38acgyglEb7lAApT3792VklHKQ4EUnXr84Ox8) to capture results of the questionnaire. You can use Sheet 2 on this template to apply the SUS formula and calculate a SUS score per user.\
