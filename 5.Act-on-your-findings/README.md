# Conveying Test Results

Once you are done evaluating your prototype,the next step is to analyze the results, convey these test results to your audience and implement changes. 

## Analyzing results

**Quantitative data**  
Record quantitative results in a spreadsheet. This can include ratings from questionnaire, if a task was completed, time to complete a task etc. Note that time to complete a task might not be useful for testing data visualizations and questionnaire ratings might be a better way to measure tasks. 
This is an example of a 
[sample quantitative template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/33q07ixbsq8q2yc/User%20Session%20Analysis.xlsx?dl=0). 


**Qualitative Data**
Record qualitative test results like answers to open ended questions, observations, issues faced etc. This is a [sample qualitative template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjcr98eekljgp76/SummarySheet.pdf?dl=0) that can be used to summarize the interview.   

While analyzing results, issues with the prototype/design should be recorded as problem statements that are concise. 
"Good problem statement: Clicked on link to Research instead of Clinical Trials.
Poor problem statement: Clicked on wrong link.
Poor problem statement: Was confused about links."    


The next step is to "note the severity of the problems on a three- or four-point scale. For example:  
Critical:  If we do not fix this, users will not be able to complete the scenario.
Serious:  Many users will be frustrated if we do not fix this; they may give up.
Minor:  Users are annoyed, but this does not keep them from completing the scenario. This should be revisited later."
Some factors that influence the severity of the problem are frequency of issues and impact of issues.

The final step is to generate solution ideas for each issue starting with the most critical issues. Use the [potential actions checklist](./Checklist-of-potential-actions.md) to identify what changes can be made.   
 

## Conveying findings  
The methods used to convey findings can range from detailed reports, presentations to emails. This depends on your audience and time frame.   

An example method of conveying results is a findings and recommendations matrix.
