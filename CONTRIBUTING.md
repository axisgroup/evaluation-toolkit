## Contributing

We love new ideas that push this repository and design engagement forward. We are using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues/) 
for tracking our work on the repository. Here are the ways that you can contribute:

### Contribute with Issues
All the open issues are being tracked on the [issue](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues/new) page. You can contribute by adding new issues, or solving an existing issue.

#### Submit a new issue
If you find a mistake, or have questions about the process, you can add a new [issue](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues/new), and one of the design team members will review the issue and respond to it.

#### Work on an existing issue
1. You can find the list of open issues [here](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/issues) 
2. Enter your thoughts as comments  
3. Assign yourself to the issue if you want to make some changes so that we know someone is working on it
4. Make changes and submit a Pull Request. [Here's how](#quick-guide-for-pull-requests).

### Make Changes in Your Branch
You can create a new branch, which is essentially a duplicate of the repo for you, and make changes under your branch. Then submit a pull request, which is a request to merge your branch with the master branch. The design team will review the pull request and decide whether we should merge the branchs or not. 
Here are the three simple steps:
1. Create a branch
   * Click on the Branch dropdown
   * Type in a name for the branch: "New Branch"
   * Click on "Create branch: New Branch"
2. Commit changes
3. Submit a pull request
   * Click on new pull request button
   * Select "Master" as base (should be default), and your branch as compare
   * Click on create pull request button

Here's a more detailed guide to [Pull Requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Here are some examples of changes you can make in your branch:

#### Recommend a method

If you have successful experience using a method and you want to recommend it to the design engagement, you can add a new .md file that describes the method under the folder [Methods](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/Methods) in your branch and then submit a pull request. 

The description file should include:
* Definition and purpose of the method
* Which phase it belongs to
* How it works
* Examples
* References or resources

#### Add photos and examples from previous engagements

The more examples that we have the better it will be to spread knowledge and experience of running the sprints. 
Listed below are steps for adding examples:

1. Edit the README in the folder where you want to add new assets
2. Add assets that support the explanation of the engagement such as photos, documents, prototypes or videos. Make sure the examples are anonymized. 
3. Add references on the separate phases to the respective parts of the example.
4. Submit a Pull Request
