## Testing Mindset

**1. Set your Expectations**

Not everything can be tested, due to the many constraints such as limited time, budget, and access to users.

**2. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize**

Pick a few design principles or considerations that are key to your application and evaluate only those criteria.

**3. No amount of testing will make your design perfect so instead aim for good enough**

Design is inherently about trade-offs, so your design will NEVER be perfect. In the spirit of iterative refinement, you should accept that! Your test, just like your design, should be good enough to surface the immediate problems that are impediments to the user.

**4. Not everything requires user-testing**

Some things can be tested by your internal team or against industry standards or best practices, i.e. which chart type serves best for a certain analysis?
Software tools can also help ease some burden of testing, i.e. Sim Daltonism can be used for for testing accessibility of colors 

**5. Not everything has to be ‘INTUITIVE’**

This is especially applicable to data analysis, where it takes time to produce insights. 
Also, in expecting everything to be automatically intuitive, we discredit our user’s ability to learn.

**6. Some things you just can’t control**

Such as...
* Availability and commitment of users 
* Accelerated timelines
* Limitations in technology
