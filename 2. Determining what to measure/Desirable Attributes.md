## Usable

To what degree does the product behave in a way users expect it to and the ease with which it users can use it for what they intend to. 

This can further be broken down as the following attributes:

### Learnable
- Is it immediately understandable? If not, is it understandable after a short period of study?

**Scaffolds**
Does the interface guide and constrain users to select appropriate actions when initially learning?

**Adaptive**

Does the interface mature as the user gains more experience?

**Transfer**

Are users able to apply learning from one context to another?

**Rewarding/Motivating**
Are users encouraged to explore the interface?

### Efficient
- What kind of visualization might have been better? For example, if somebody has given you a set of multiple pie charts, and you have to compare pie wedges, from one to the other, is that really the best way to make those comparisons, or could a bar chart have done the job just as well, maybe better? 

### Effective
- Does the visualization successfully highlight important information, while providing context for that information? Is new information gleaned from the visualization that wouldn't have come from an alternative method and is the important information highlighted and is the context not hidden?

## Desirable
