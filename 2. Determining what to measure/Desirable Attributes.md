## Useful

### Informative

- Does the visualization reveal trends, patterns, gaps, or outliers? Can the viewer make effective comparisons?
- Can the viewer make effective comparisons?

### Insightful

- Does it provide insight or understanding that was not obtainable with the original representation, text or table, etc?
- Does it provide insight or understanding better than some alternative visualization would? Or does it require excessive cognitive effort?

### Helpful
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
- Is help documentation easy to search? Is it focused on the user's task?
- Doest it list concrete steps to be carried out without being overwhelming?

Purposeful

Supports creativity

Supports analysis

Cognitively stimulating


## Usable

To what degree does the product behave in a way users expect it to and the ease with which it users can use it for what they intend to. 

This can further be broken down as the following attributes:

### Learnable

**Focused**
- Is it immediately understandable? If not, is it understandable after a short period of study?

**Guided/Provides Scaffolds**
- Does the interface guide and constrain users to select appropriate actions when initially learning?

**Adaptive**

- Does the interface mature as the user gains more experience?

**Transferable**

- Are users able to apply learning from one context to another?

**Rewarding/Motivating**
- Are users encouraged to explore the interface?

### Efficient
- What kind of visualization might have been better? For example, if somebody has given you a set of multiple pie charts, and you have to compare pie wedges, from one to the other, is that really the best way to make those comparisons, or could a bar chart have done the job just as well, maybe better? 

### Effective
- Does the visualization successfully highlight important information, while providing context for that information? Is new information gleaned from the visualization that wouldn't have come from an alternative method and is the important information highlighted and is the context not hidden?

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
