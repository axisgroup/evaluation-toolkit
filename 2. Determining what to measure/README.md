## Useful, Usable, Desirable Framework

While there are many different ways to categorize qualities of a visualization we will look at them from the lens of Usefulness, Usability and Desirability. The rationale behind this is that these roughly map to reflective, behavioral and visceral feedback from users.

- Usefulness- How do people think about the interface?
- Usable- How do people behave with the interface?
- Desirable- How do people react to the interface?
