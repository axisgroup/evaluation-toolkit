## Useful, Usable, Desirable Framework

While there are many different ways to categorize qualities of a visualization we will look at them from the lens of Usefulness, Usability and Desirability. The rationale behind this is that these roughly map to reflective, behavioral and visceral feedback from users.

- Usefulness- How do people think about the interface?
- Usable- How do people behave with the interface?
- Desirable- How do people react to the interface?

Use these higher order categories as axes to reflect on rather than hard and fast rules. It is also important to understand that individual attributes lie on a spectrum rather than being purely usable or purly useful or purely desirable.
