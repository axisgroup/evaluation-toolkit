Another means of evaluating visualizations is by crossing them against this list of undesirable attributes, and making changes accordingly.

## Inefficient
- too many clicks or a roundabout way to complete a task
- using a viz that's harder to read when you could use something thats more simple
- too many pages in an app/ redundant information on multiple views?

## Confusing
- can't find the info you're looking for
- viz is extremely complex or difficult to read
- don't know what the purpose of a screen or view is, or how it's supposed to help you

## Frustrating
- ugliness, not intuitive, too many clicks to do your task, etc.
- annoying - like too many alerts or notifications, or things not working the way you expect (i.e. filters)
- or too many interactions/animations

## Boring
- everything is the same viz? 
- everything is gray?
- language is dull? 

## Making one feel stupid
- if language is patronizing/assuming you dont know anything
- if a viz is unnecessarily complex 

## Gimmicky
- flashy with no purpose, deceptive, seems to be more "persuasive" than informative
 
## Untrustworthy
 - linked to data being inaccurate
